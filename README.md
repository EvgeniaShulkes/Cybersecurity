# Hi, I am Evgenia Shulkes. 
**Multilingual Technical and Content marketing writer, UX writer, and Cybersecurity enthusiast**

I speak **5** languages (**Hebrew, English, French, Russian, and German**), 
and have over **12** years of experience making complex ideas easy to understand –
through guides, documentation, marketing content, UX copy, and more.

Recently, I completed cybersecurity-related courses and am continuing to expand my knowledge in this field. I'm a fast learner, curious, and detail-oriented – with a strong ability to adapt my writing to different tones and audiences.

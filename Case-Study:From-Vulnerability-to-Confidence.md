>It can never happen to me<—that’s what most of us think when we hear about devastating cyber attacks. But for CustSerFirst, a rising SaaS startup, that illusion was shattered overnight.

##**Challenge**
>One bright morning, the team opened their computers to a chilling discovery: sensitive customer data, project details, and financial records had been quietly exfiltrated over weeks without detection. A ransom note awaited them, demanding payment to prevent the information from being leaked. CustSerFirst had fallen victim to a ransomware attack—where cybercriminals steal sensitive data and threaten to release it unless their demands are met.

How could it happen? The company invested heavily in antivirus software, firewalls, endpoint security (measures protecting individual devices and networks from threats). Yet, the attackers managed to breach their defenses.

That’s when DetectRespondAI, a cybersecurity startup which specializes in AI-powered threat detection and response, came to their aid.
